# 3. Prioritize & Plan Integrations

After identifying missing and optional integrations, use this checklist to prioritize and plan their implementation.

---

## a. Assess Impact & Feasibility
- [ ] Evaluate each integration for potential impact on user experience and business goals.
- [ ] Assess technical feasibility, including complexity, maintenance, and security.
- [ ] Estimate implementation time and required resources.

## b. Rank Integrations
- [ ] Assign priority to each integration (High, Medium, Low).
- [ ] Discuss priorities with stakeholders and development team.

## c. Create Action Plan
- [ ] Break high-priority integrations into actionable tasks and user stories.
- [ ] Assign ownership and deadlines to each task.
- [ ] Track progress using your project management tool (GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello, etc.).

## d. Monitor & Iterate
- [ ] Review integration outcomes after launch.
- [ ] Collect user feedback and analytics.
- [ ] Refine and iterate the integration plan as needed.

**Tip:**  
Use sprint cycles to implement integrations incrementally. Communicate priorities and progress regularly with your team.
