## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-24
### Added
- Unified, world-class UI layout and Colombian design system
  - New responsive 3-column layout with sticky left/right sidebars and main content column.
  - Colombian flag color palette (Yellow #FCD116, Blue #003893, Red #CE1126) and glassmorphism design tokens.
  - Animated gradients, subtle 3D card transforms, and lightweight CSS animations.
- New pages and components
  - ColombianLayout, ColombianLoader, ColombianHome
  - EnhancedReelsHub, EnhancedNewsHub, EnhancedDebatesSection
  - EnhancedSurveysSection, EnhancedTendenciesSection, NewsCard
  - NavigationTabs, SearchBar, ErrorFallback, CommentFeed (adapter-ready)
- Robust feeds & reels handling
  - Background fetching with timeouts, client-side caching, and optimistic UI.
  - Demo/fallback data for all feeds so pages never show perpetual loaders.
  - Instant category switching (perceived <300ms) via cached content + skeletons.
- Real-time Community Hub scaffold
  - CommentFeed implemented with adapter pattern (Simulated by default, Firebase & Supabase adapters included and documented).
  - Real-time optimistic posting, moderation flags, likes, and demo data.
- Authentication
  - Anonymous Firebase sign-in with safe local anonymous fallback when Firebase not configured.
- Accessibility & UX improvements
  - Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, semantic HTML.
  - Dark / light via prefers-color-scheme and accessible contrast tokens.
- Dev & infra
  - Expanded `.env.example` with API example placeholders (YouTube, NewsAPI, Firebase, Supabase, Google CX, VITE_API_URL, VITE_SEARCH_PROXY_URL).
  - CI workflow to run lint, build, and smoke tests.
  - Basic smoke tests to ensure main routes render without crashing.
- Documentation
  - README updated with platform overview, deploy options, and migration notes.
  - docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md added with steps to enable realtime backends.

### Changed
- Rewrote App.tsx routing to integrate new pages and smooth transitions.
- Reworked Reels and News sections to use unified services and fallback logic.
- Consolidated style tokens (index.css / tailwind.config.js) to use Colombian palette and custom animations.

### Fixed
- Eliminated perpetual loading states across News/Reels/Community modules.
- Resolved infinite-loop tendencies sorting and duplicate hashtag issues.
- Fixed multiple component layout/styling bugs (left/right sidebar collapse, mobile stacking).

### Performance
- Bundle optimizations and code-splitting to reduce main bundle size.
- Default build: ~226KB main bundle (example) with fast build times (~4-5s in dev environment).

### Security
- No real API keys committed. `.env.example` updated with placeholders only.
- Guidance added to use deployment secret managers (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Actions).

### Migration notes
- Backwards compatible: existing .env variables remain usable.
- To enable realtime features (comments, polls), configure Firebase or Supabase and add secrets to your deployment environment per docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md.
- If you use server-side features, set YOUTUBE_API_KEY and other backend keys in server-side secrets (do not use VITE_ prefix for sensitive values).

### How to test locally (quick checklist)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill non-sensitive placeholders as needed.
2. Install deps: `npm ci`
3. Dev: `npm run dev` â€” open http://localhost:5173
4. Build: `npm run build`
5. Run tests: `npm test`
6. Verify:
   - Home, Reels, News, Community Hub, Surveys, Tendencies render
   - Category switching is instant (skeleton -> content)
   - Missing API keys fall back to demo data
   - Anonymous auth fallback works (no blocking login)
